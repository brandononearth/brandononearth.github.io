                <p class="bySide">I managed a variety of projects for FilmTrack during my time there working in a cross-functional role as a project manager. I was responsible for marketing-related web properties as well as transactional and product email templates. This role required a holistic understanding of the user experience for a user’s time inside and outside our product. On this project I worked with a Product Marketing Manager, VP of Marketing, three Product Managers as well as various stakeholders in Sales and Support. I made continual updates and changes in response to testing, feedback, and business goals during the 14-month lifecycle of the project.</p>

                        <p>This project aimed to serve a shared need between product, marketing, and support teams. Users needed a streamlined way to learn more about lesser-known product features and to get live demonstrations on new features. A group of account managers trialed several ad hoc Skype training sessions and wanted to develop a more manageable solution. The original series was not reaching the desired audience and did not have a consistent, professional communication strategy. Working with stakeholders, I developed three goals for this project:</p>

                            <li>Reduce the number of requests to support/account managers about the series.</li>
                            <li>Create an iterable communication strategy.</li>

                    <h5 class="sectionTitle">Constraints</h5>
				    <p>Due to constraints on development resources, I needed to find an external platform to host the webinars, provide access to past recordings, and manage reminders and general communications about the series. The teams wanted the series to be single opt-in and not to be publicly visible. These constraints prevented initial in-app integration, so the solution needed to be grounded externally but integrate seamlessly with a user’s normal workflow.</p>

                    <h5 class="sectionTitle">Approach</h5>
				<p>Before moving to the day-to-day series, we looked at the current training method users experienced. Users whose company opted for full implementation could receive instructor-lead training onsite. In other instances training was conducted on a 1:1 basis remotely or onsite. To reduce mutual strain on resources and to get users more comfortable with exploring and using new functionality, the team opted for a broadcast training method. This training method offered the best balance between 1:1 coaching and a knowledge base. We tabled a knowledge base early on since creating one wouldn’t solve the need for human-led training and Q&amp;A and the resources required to create such a tool would far outweigh the benefits to users or reduction in support time. Working with the product experts, I outlined a process for the user to learn about, request, and register for training sessions. The marketing team and I settled on an email-focused communication strategy.<p>

                    <p>I outlined a series introduction emails which could be repurposed as the autoresponder welcome email for new series subscribers. Next, I conducted research on industry standard practice for email frequency for webinars. Based on this research of six webinar series for similar SaaS platforms, I planned to A/B test the two most common approaches once the series had begun. I completed mockups of training landing pages, emails, and presentation materials. Using a branding guideline established in an earlier project, I created custom illustrations to develop a cohesive mini brand around the training series. This branding helped users recognize the series. As the branding developed during the course of the program, we experienced better retention, less confusion, and ease in onboarding new users.</p>

                        <p>Over the course of the project we learned a number of things that helped improve the training program. The primary industry served by the software showed better registration and attendance rates when the sessions occurred on a Thursday. Performance and program abandon rate were best when reminder emails were staggered at 2 week, 1 week, 1 day intervals. I worked with the original stakeholders to integrate the training program into the account implementation process. Overall, the training program led to increased user confidence, reduced strain on support, and a collection of templates to pull from for future user-focused programs. We produced the following deliverables:</p>
